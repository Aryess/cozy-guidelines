## Support Request

Here is the process that occurs when a user requires assistance 
via the forum, IRC or Cozy Cloud contact email:

1. A team member answers to the user and invite him to share 
   his problem on the forum.
2. Several ways:
  * If the assistance requirement is related to the Cozy 
    infrastructure, it is redirected to our IT Team.
  * If the problem is related to bug, it starts 
    [Bug Report](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/blob/master/process/bug-report.md) process.
  * If the problem can be solved, one answer should be enough
  * If the problem requires more work, an issue is 
    opened on the dedicated repository with the tag `question` and the user is informed.
3. In the case of long assistance, when the issue is 
   answered the issue is closed:
  * Immediately after an acknowledgement of the user
  * One week after if there user didn't answer to the solution.
