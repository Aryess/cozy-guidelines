# Labels

## Non process-related

Three labels are used to identify issues:

* bug: the issue is a bug and should be fixed in priority
* enhancement: feature request
* question: support request

## Process-related

For projects based on huboard, there are other labels:

* backlog: list of reported bugs and feature requests
* todo: current sprint to-do list
* in progress: current issue a developer is working on
* qa: functional review by the product owner
* published: published in a official version of the app/module
