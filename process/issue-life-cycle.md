# Issue Life Cycle

Issue status will be:

* Backlog (listed)
* Todo (what to do for the current sprint)
* In Progress (Someone is working on it)
* QA (PR is opened here. Both technical and functional reviews occurs here, if something is wrong, the status go back to In progress)
* Published (The PR is merged and a new version is created.)

Pull request status:

* In progress.
* QA (if something is wrong, the status go back to In progress)
* Merged

Additional info: A PR is sync with an issue if it's related to a single issue. But most of time a PR contains several issue fixings.

Hubboard works well on project that uses a single board. I think we can let the choice to the PO between Trello and Hubboard.
